Andy Murray Beats Error-Prone Novak Djokovic to Retain No. 1 Ranking LONDON - As Andy Murray closed in this fall on Novak Djokovic's run of more than 
two years at No. 1 and then overtook him this month, one thing was missing: a punctuating win over Djokovic, his toughest and longest rival. The two h
ad not met since June 5, when Djokovic defeated Murray in the French Open final to complete a career Grand Slam. You can only beat who you're playing 
against, the top-ranked Murray said on the eve of Sunday's winner-take-all showdown against Djokovic at the ATP World Tour Finals. Murray's convincing
 6-3, 6-4 win in front of 17,800 boisterous fans at the O2 Arena gave him the signature victory he craved, as well as his first World Tour Finals titl
e. It ensured that he would end 2016 holding the top ranking for the first time, no small feat in an era of historic greats. Djokovic, Roger Federer a
nd Rafael Nadal have taken turns holding the No. 1 slot over the past 12 years. Andy Roddick, in 2003, was the last player other than those three to e
nd the season at No. 1. Murray and his older brother, Jamie, also became the first siblings to rank No. 1 in singles and as part of a doubles team to 
end the year. Jamie and his Brazilian partner, Bruno Soares, clinched the top ranking on Friday. Although Djokovic had fresher legs, Murray's unrelent
ing resilience, peaking confidence and dictating baseline play ruled the day. I'm happy to get the win today and finish the year No. 1, Murray said on
 the court shortly after Djokovic's forehand return sailed long on his third match point, which denied him a fifth consecutive crown and extended Murr
ay's unbeaten streak to 24 matches. It's very special, and something I never expected. Few did. In the first half of the season, Djokovic had looked n
early invincible, squelching Murray and everyone else on the sport's biggest stages. He had won three of the two players' four meetings during that ti
me, in the finals of the Australian Open, the French Open and the Madrid Open. Murray notched a straight-set win in the title match in Rome. Djokovic 
looked as if he was on course for the first true Grand Slam by a man since Rod Laver's in 1969. But Murray, a sometimes grouchy, self-critical player 
who had become a father in February, pushed himself to the verge of the top spot during a spectacular second half. After splitting in June with his co
ach, Amélie Mauresmo, Murray rehired his former coach, the no-nonsense Ivan Lendl. Their chemistry worked, and Murray won Wimbledon and a gold medal 
in singles at the Rio Olympics, both for the second time. Lendl had helped guide Murray to his first two major titles, at the 2012 United States Open 
and at Wimbledon the next year. After falling in the United States Open quarterfinals to Kei Nishikori, Murray went on a tear. He won titles in Beijin
g, Shanghai, Vienna and Paris, where he ended Djokovic's 122-week run at No. 1 and ascended to the top spot for the first time on Nov 7. Djokovic, mea
nwhile, was uncharacteristically wobbly. He lost in the third round at Wimbledon to Sam Querrey, in the first round at the Olympics to Juan Martín de
l Potro and in the United States Open final to Stan Wawrinka. His last tournament win was at the Rogers Cup in July. On Sunday, Djokovic said he had s
uffered a letdown after finally winning the French Open, and he called the last few months far from ideal. I needed some time to really take it all in
, digest it, he said. If little separated Murray and Djokovic before Sunday, freshness was not it. Murray had logged nearly 10 hours on the court in L
ondon, including the two longest three-set contests of 2016. He already had played a tour-high 86 matches, with 77 wins. He needed 3 hours 21 minutes 
to defeat Nishikori on Wednesday. Against Milos Raonic of Canada in Saturday's semifinals, Murray saved a match point during a tense victory that took
 3 hours 38 minutes. By contrast, Djokovic needed 6 hours 33 minutes for his four victories, including a 6-1, 6-1 drubbing of Nishikori in the semifin
als of the tournament. Their divergent seasons had come down, fittingly, to the final match of the year. After an uneasy start, Murray controlled patt
erns from the baseline, particularly on his forehand. He kept rallies shorter than usual, was broken just once late in the second set, and came up wit
h several big serves on crucial points. Djokovic, by contrast, lacked his usual pinpoint footwork and depth of shot. He appeared uncertain at key mome
nts and hit 30 unforced errors - many off his vaunted backhand - to just 15 by Murray. More than anything, he felt comfortable in the rallies and exac
tly knew what to do, said Djokovic, who finished No. 1 in four of the past six years. On the other hand, I hesitated, and it didn't work. For his part
, Murray said he was lucky I got it finished in two sets. Murray had never beaten Djokovic in four previous matches indoors, and he still trails in th
eir overall head-to-head record, 24-11.
