ipation and expectation that will come their way now. Mourinho has w
confidence transmits itself to top players. It is a priceless commod
d as a touch arrogant by some people, and maybe he can appear that w
good game - he's won some very big games such as the Champions Leagu
actions. I've also found him to be very realistic whenever I've hear
r lots of managers have spent money and it has not worked. The buys 
 extra dimension.  In the early games he was slaughtered for defensi
ason, but you can certainly lose them and those points on the board 
were not scoring goals they were creating chances by the hatful. Now
and things are looking good. I just wonder if they lack a predator, 
e was sidelined, but you have to feel if Chelsea had a Ruud van Nist
the tools to go far in the Champions League. I felt they would never
ope so far this season. It will now be very interesting to see how M
a's squad. I have said I believed Chelsea would win the league this 
e me change me mind.  If anything, what I have seen has confirmed my
y defensive display at Spurs, even though they ran out 5-4 winners.
