 lasers, robot submarines and diamond saws. But they are, in fact, the kind of tools that engineers 
will need to dispose of hundreds of the soon-to-be-derelict oil and gas platforms littering the Nort
h Sea. While clean, green offshore wind farms increasingly begin to populate the North Sea - there a
re now 3,000 of them there - the area's once-mighty oil and gas platforms, which helped fuel Europe'
